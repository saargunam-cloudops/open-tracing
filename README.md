Jaeger Tracing Setup Guide
This guide will help you enable Jaeger tracing for your Python project. Follow the steps below to get started:

Step 1: Install the Jaeger Client library
In your terminal, run the following command to install the Jaeger Client library:

Copy code
pip install jaeger-client opentracing-instrumentation
Step 2: Launch the Jaeger backend

bash
Copy code
docker run -d -p 6831:6831/udp -p 16686:16686 jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
Step 3: Run your Python program
Finally, run your Python program and include the following code to start tracing:

python
Copy code
import jaeger_client
from jaeger_client import Config

# Your Python code here
That's it! Your Python project is now set up for Jaeger tracing.
